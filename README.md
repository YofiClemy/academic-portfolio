# Academic Portfolio — Labs and Projects

> Selected lab reports and projects for Electrical Engineering coursework (UNSE FCEyT).

This repo is organized with one-minute READMEs in each project, then full report PDFs, data and code.

## Contents
- `electronics/` analog/digital electronics labs
- `measurements/` measurement setups with uncertainty and propagation
- `logics/` logic systems, timing/state diagrams, HDL/testbench
- `machines/` Rankine cycle and internal combustion analyses
- `Portfolio.pdf` one-page index with links
