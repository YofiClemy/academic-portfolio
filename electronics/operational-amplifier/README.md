# Operational amplifier

> Context: Undergraduate lab at UNSE.

## Problem
1–2 lines describing what was built/measured.

## Setup
- Instruments/components: Model numbers of DMM/oscilloscope/PSU/signal generator; components list.
- Diagram/photo: `figures/setup.png` (add your photo/diagram)
- Block diagram: `figures/block-diagram.png`

## Method
Brief steps: simulate, build, measure; include sampling rate, averaging, calibration.

## Key results
- Mean: …
- σ (std dev): …
- % error: …
- Bandwidth / efficiency / propagation example: …

## What I learned / skills
e.g., 4-wire resistance, Wheatstone, LTspice, Proteus, MATLAB, Python, HDL/testbench.

**My analysis approach**  
State assumptions, derive expected behavior, simulate for bounds, measure, compute uncertainty (Type A/B), propagate errors, reconcile deltas with non-idealities.
