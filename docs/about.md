# About

I'm **Clément**, an Electrical Engineering student (UNSE, Argentina) focusing on **Power Systems & Automation**.
I’m building a Europe-ready skillset (PowerFactory, PLC/SCADA, protection basics) and documenting hands-on labs
in measurements, electronics, and control/logic.

- **Interests:** grid automation, SCADA/PLC, protection, power quality, and energy systems integration.
- **Experience:** 3 years as **Teaching Assistant (informatics)**; multiple lab projects (measurements & electronics).
- **Languages:** Spanish (native), English (advanced), French (intermediate).
- **Now:** assembling a portfolio of clean, reproducible labs and small tools for utilities/automation recruiters.

**This site** is a curated, privacy‑safe portfolio. Instructor names and collaborator identities are anonymized.
